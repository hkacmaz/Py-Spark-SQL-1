# Py-Spark-SQL-1
The story of sql, hadoop, hive, python and spark.

  Back in the 1990s the neigborhoods were small and there were not many apartments which has many floors.
Think about that time, we have a 5 floor apartment one doorman.

  Every morning doorman knocks and asks each door what do they want from the grocery store. The request from apartmant
is basically a SQL back in 1990s when there was no big data, and the doorman was the RDBMS which stands for relational database management system. We ask to get the data(foods) with SQL(speech) from database(grocery store) with RMBMS(doorman) and then it displayed to us (the food has brought to us).
