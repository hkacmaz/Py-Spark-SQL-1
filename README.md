# Py-Spark-SQL-1
The story of sql, hadoop, hive, python and spark.

  Back in the 1990s the neigborhoods were small and there were not many apartments which has many floors.
Think about that time, we have a 5 floor apartment complex and total 20 apartments, and one doorman.
Every morning doorman ask each renter/landlord what do they want from the grocery store. The request from renter/landlord
is basically SQL back in 1990s when there was no big data, and the doorman was the RDBMS which stands for relational database
management system. We ask to get the foods with SQL(speech)  to RMBMS(doorman) and then it displayed to us
(the food has brought to us).
